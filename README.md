# Machine Learning & Deep Learning Projects with PyTorch

This repository contains a series of Jupyter Notebooks that explore fundamental concepts in machine learning and deep learning, from basic algorithms to advanced neural network architectures. Each notebook serves as a practical, hands-on implementation of a key topic using PyTorch.

***
## Projects

The projects are ordered to build upon foundational concepts, creating a clear learning path.

| # | Topic | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **Perceptron** | An implementation of the simplest single-neuron network for binary classification. |
| 2 | **Gradient Descent** | A deep dive into the foundational optimization algorithm used to train neural networks. |
| 3 | **Universal Function Approximator** | A demonstration of how neural networks can be used to approximate any continuous function. |
| 4 | **Multi-Output & Batch Processing** | Techniques for handling models with multiple outputs and processing data in batches for efficiency. |
| 5 | **Classification in PyTorch** | Building a complete multi-class image classification model using core PyTorch components. |
| 6 | **Convolutional Networks (CNNs)** | Implementing a CNN from scratch to solve image recognition tasks. |
| 7 | **Transfer Learning** | Leveraging a pre-trained model (like ResNet) and fine-tuning it for a new, custom dataset. |
| 8 | **Open-Set Classification** | Tackling the challenge of identifying samples that do not belong to any of the known training classes. |
| 9 | **Convolutional Auto-Encoder** | Building an unsupervised neural network for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction on images. |
| 10 | **Learn to Write Like Shakespeare** | Implementing an Elman network for character-level text generation to create new text in the style of Shakespeare. |

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you will need a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-name>
    ```
2.  Install the required libraries. A `requirements.txt` file is recommended, but you can also install the core packages manually:
    ```bash
    pip install torch torchvision numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

### Usage
Navigate to the repository directory and launch Jupyter:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Then, open any of the `.ipynb` files to explore the projects.
